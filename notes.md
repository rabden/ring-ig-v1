# Notification System Analysis

## Key Files Structure
1. Context:
   - `src/contexts/NotificationContext.jsx` - Global notification management

2. Components:
   - `src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.jsx` - Notification indicator
   - `src/components/notifications/NotificationItem.jsx` - Individual notification items
   - `src/components/notifications/NotificationList.jsx` - Container for notifications
   - `src/components/MobileNotificationsMenu.jsx` - Mobile-specific notifications view

3. Integration Points:
   - `App.jsx` - NotificationProvider wrapper
   - `DesktopHeader.jsx` - NotificationBell integration
   - `BottomNavbar.jsx` - Mobile notification integration

## NotificationContext Implementation
1. State Management:
   - Uses React Context API
   - Maintains notifications array and unreadCount
   - Integrates with Supabase for real-time updates

2. Key Features:
   - Real-time notification updates via Supabase channels
   - User-specific notifications filtering
   - Automatic unread count management
   - Sorted by creation date (descending)

3. Core Functions:
   - `markAsRead(notificationId)` - Mark notification as read
   - `deleteNotification(notificationId)` - Remove notification
   - `fetchNotifications()` - Get user's notifications

4. Database Integration:
   - Uses Supabase 'notifications' table
   - Real-time subscription to notification changes
   - User-specific filtering using session.user.id
